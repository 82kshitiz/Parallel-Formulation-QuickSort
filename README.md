# Parallel-Formulation-QuickSort
message-passing parallel formulation of the Quicksort algorithm
* Quicksort is one of the most common sorting algorithms for sequential computers because of its
simplicity, low overhead, and optimal average complexity.
* Quicksort selects one of the entries in the sequence to be the pivot and divides the sequence
into two - one with all elements less than the pivot and other greater.
* The process is recursively applied to each of the sublists.
